    <h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Services, Deployments, Pods are all <strong>Objects</strong> in Kubernetes, everytime we need to create or modify an Object, we need to create or update a <strong>config</strong> file</p>
<p>So let's start by creating a config file for our Node Service.</p>
<p><img src="../../doc_assets/screenshots/Docker/posts-srv.png" alt="posts-srv"></p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-yml"><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: posts-srv
  labels:
    app: posts-srv
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: posts
  ports:  # List of ports to be exposed
    - name: posts 
      protocol: TCP
      port: 4000
      targetPort: 4000
</code></pre>
<p>let's take a look at the ports section where we list out all the different ports that we want to expose on a target pod.</p>
<p>Well, let me give you a quick reminder on the Post Service really quickly, or our Post application inside of our post application directory.</p>
<p>I'm going to open up the index file.</p>
<p>At the very bottom, you'll recall that we had said, listen, on port *<em>4000</em>.</p>
<p>So our application application is listening for traffic on port <strong>4000</strong></p>
<p>Inside of our service, we need to make sure that we specifically expose Port 4000 on our part.</p>
<p>So that's what this ports section is all about.</p>
<p>We're going to list out all the different ports that we want to expose on the port.</p>
<p>We specify a protocal of <strong>TCP</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>port of 4000</strong> and a <strong>target port of 4000</strong>.</p>
<p>I got some bad news, these poor properties right here are pretty darn confusing, I'm not going to lie to you.</p>
<p>So what are these all about?</p>
<p>Well, again, if we think about our post application, it is listening for traffic on Port 4000.</p>
<p>So this 4000 right here is essentially saying we want to open up access on port for thousands.</p>
<p>But real quick question.</p>
<p>Why are we listing this out twice?</p>
<p>What is the difference between port and target ports?</p>
<p>Let me show you a diagram.</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you right away.</p>
<p>This diagram is probably going to make things a little bit more confusing.</p>
<p><img src="../../doc_assets/screenshots/Docker/post-targetPort.png" alt="port-targetPort"></p>
<p>These objects on the left hand side is our browser.</p>
<p>On a far right hand side is the actual pod that is running our post container now on that container,</p>
<p>we've got some application that is listing for traffic on port 4000.</p>
<p>We refer to that port that is attached to the container.</p>
<p>So the ultimate port that we want to direct traffic to as the target ports.</p>
<p>So target port back over here.</p>
<p>This is the actual port that our application is listening for traffic on.</p>
<p>That's where we ultimately want to send traffic to.</p>
<p>We are creating a node port service the node port service is going to have a port of its own, so that is referred to as simply at the port and that is what this property is right here.</p>
<p>So we are sending traffic to Port 4000 on a node port service, and that service internally is going to redirect that traffic over to Port 4000 on the container itself.</p>
<p>The port and the target port do not have to be identical, so this could be 5000 on the port.</p>
<p>And if we make a request to Port 5000 on the node port service, the service will redirect</p>
<p>that traffic to Port 4000 on the container.</p>
